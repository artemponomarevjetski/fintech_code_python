# fintech_code_python
Collection of code and data for the markets.

I did lots of work with Python, SQL, MS workbench, data studio, pandas, servers, database mounting, containers, cloud execution, backtesting of pricing data, building timestamped repository of financial historical data on merger and acquisitions and modeling merger and acquisitions arbitrage.
