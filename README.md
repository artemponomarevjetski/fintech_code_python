# fintech_code_python
Different code and data I did for FORA capital.

I did lots of work with Python, SQL, MS workbench, data studio, pandas, servers, database mounting, containers, cloud execution, backtesting of pricing data, building timestamped repository of financial historical data on merger and acquisitions and modeling merger and acquisitions arbitrage.
